## Description

 GWA Calculator is a web application designed to help students calculate their General Weighted Average quickly and accurately. Built with modern web technologies, it simplifies the process of tracking academic performance by allowing users to input their grades and corresponding unit weights. I created this project to address the common challenge students face when computing their GWA manually, reducing errors and saving time.
